# jsHiteshCourse
Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey 🎉. I'm currently learning JavaScript through this awesome [YouTube course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37)
 by Chai aur Code.

This repository, #jsHiteshCourse, is where I’m documenting key JavaScript concepts and making detailed notes on topics like arrays, objects, functions, and more. It’s a work in progress, and I’m constantly adding new insights as I advance through the course.

Feel free to explore, learn with me, and even contribute if you like! 😄

Happy coding! 💻✨
