# jsHiteshCourse
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸŽ‰. I'm currently learning JavaScript through this awesome YouTube course by Chai aur Code.

This repository, #jsHiteshCourse, is where Iâ€™m documenting key JavaScript concepts and making detailed notes on topics like arrays, objects, functions, and more. Itâ€™s a work in progress, and Iâ€™m constantly adding new insights as I advance through the course.

Feel free to explore, learn with me, and even contribute if you like! ðŸ˜„

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
