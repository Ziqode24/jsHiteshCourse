# jsHiteshCourse
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸŽ‰. I'm currently learning JavaScript through this awesome [YouTube course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37)
 by Chai aur Code.

Iâ€™m creating this repository, #jsHiteshCourse, in which I plan to jot down any key JavaScript concepts as well as notes in greater detail on specific topics, arrays, objects, functions, and so on. It's still very much a work in progress as I will be adding it as I move through the course. 
Feel free to explore, learn with me, and even contribute if you like! ðŸ˜„

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
